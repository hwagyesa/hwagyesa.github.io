After years of doing theory[^2] , I'm trying to transition
into doing applied research. The first step is to pass industry research
position interviews. In the short term, I'll record some notes on this blog
relevant to my interview prep -- for example, basic statistical decision theory,
reinforcement learning, certain simple model implementations, basic MLsys, etc.
(things that have been "slippery" for me so far, but are not really
complicated).

In the future, if I am so fortunate, maybe I'll be able to start recording
research ideas on this blog. Stay tuned!

[^2]: With diminishing returns, probably exponentially-diminishing after 2022.
